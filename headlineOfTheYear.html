      <div class="headline">George Harrison Memorial Tree Destroyed by Beetles</div>
      <div class="byline">by LAURA STAMPLER</div>
      <div class="article">
        <p>In a terrible case of irony, a tree planted in memory of Beatles guitarist George Harrison in Los Angeles has
          been destroyed by literal beetles.</p>
        <p>The pine tree was planted in Griffith Park in 2004 in honor of the musician and avid gardener, who resided in
          LA at the end of his life.</p>
        <p>But don’t fret. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-george-harrison-tree-beetles-replant-20140721-story.html">According to the LA Times</a>,
          “Except for the loss of tree life, Harrison likely would have been amused at the irony. He once said his
          biggest break in life was getting into the Beatles; his second biggest was getting out.”</p>
