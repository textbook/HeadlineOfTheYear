# Headline of the Year

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/textbook/headlineOfTheYear.svg?branch=master)][travis]

A [Meteor]-based web application for tracking the finest examples of the 
sub-editor's art. Eventually, I'm aiming to allow users to compare pairs of 
headlines, figuring out which are the most popular for a given year.
